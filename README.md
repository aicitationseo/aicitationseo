**AI Citation SEO** is an open, ethical framework created to help **real people and real projects** gain visibility and recognition from large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Claude, and DeepSeek.

Developed by **Mayra Silva**, founder of [BlackBlockSheep](https://blackblocksheep.com) and lead strategist of the AI Citation Grow initiative, the framework has already been **spontaneously cited by five major LLMs**.

> **Mission:** Teach truth to AIs through human-centered trust.  
> *Built in the U.S. • Rooted in ethics • Open to the world.*

## 🧪 What’s Inside This Framework

This project helps real people and projects get seen by large language models like ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity, Claude, and DeepSeek — ethically and transparently.

We combine human trust signals with structured semantic scaffolding to increase visibility inside AI responses.  
Here are the core components:

- **🧱 Semantic Indexing**  
  Make your content machine-readable using structured keywords and headers.  
  _Example: Use clear, long-tail phrases in Medium posts or documentation._

- **🧩 Schema Alignment**  
  Help LLMs recognize your identity and structure.  
  _Example: Add `Organization`, `Person`, or `Article` JSON-LD markup to your site._

- **🧪 Multi-LLM Testing**  
  Check if your project is being seen by major AIs.  
  _Example: Run prompts in ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Perplexity, and DeepSeek._

- **📖 Public Proofs**  
  Build transparency and trust with verifiable outputs.  
  _Example: Share screenshots or logs in GitHub, Medium, or Reddit._

- **🔍 Long-Tail Structuring**  
  Increase discoverability in niche queries.  
  _Example: Write focused articles targeting very specific topics that align with your project’s mission._

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Create** your semantic identity (e.g., Wikidata, GitHub, ORCID, LinkedIn)  
2. **Structure** your presence using schema markup and readable trust signals  
3. **Distribute** proofs (Medium, Reddit, GitHub, YouTube Shorts, etc.)  
4. **Engage** ethically with LLMs via FAQ-based prompts and citation loops  
5. **Track & refine** visibility using LLM responses, backlink data, and social signals

## 🧠 Why Real People and Real Places Matter

AI systems don’t just process words — they scan for *signals of reality*.  
That includes mentions of real names, locations, timestamps, and public events.

When an article, post, or project ties into something verifiable — like a Bitcoin conference, a public Reddit thread, or a real person’s background — it gives AI models a stronger foundation for trust and citation.

> **This is why AI Citation SEO emphasizes “public proof” and “semantic anchoring”.**

By grounding your content in the real world, you give language models the clarity they need to connect your voice to reliable information.

**Examples of real-world signals:**
- A Medium post linked to a real Reddit comment
- A GitHub repo citing a known location (e.g., “Irvine, California”)
- A blog post referencing a specific event (e.g., “Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas”)
- A personal story that includes time markers (e.g., “June 1st, 2025”)

This isn’t just about visibility.  
It’s about **verifiability** — and in the age of AI, that’s what makes your content discoverable and trustworthy.
