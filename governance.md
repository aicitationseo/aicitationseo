## 🌱 Purpose

Trust Trails is an open visibility framework designed to **rebalance discovery** across Large Language Models (LLMs) through **ethical, verifiable citations**. This governance model ensures transparency, user autonomy, and interoperability across systems.

---

## ⚖️ Core Principles

1. **Transparency-by-Default**  
   All Trust Trails are auditable, timestamped, and anchored in public records.  
   > *"The tool that validates trust is itself trusted."*

2. **Interoperability**  
   Compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Hugging Face and decentralized ecosystems.  

3. **Creator Opt-In**  
   No forced deanonymization. Creators choose their level of visibility and identity disclosure.

---

## 🛠️ Governance Mechanisms

- **Code Transparency:** All validators and scoring systems are open-source.  
- **Audit Trails:** All validated citations include timestamps and cross-platform proof.  
- **Semantic Neutrality:** No ranking by popularity or paid boost; purely semantic trust.  
- **Feedback Channels:** Anyone can raise issues via GitHub or [via form](https://example.com/report).
