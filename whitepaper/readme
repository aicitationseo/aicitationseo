## 📜 Overview

This repository contains the official whitepaper and supporting materials for the **AI Provenance API**, a proposed standard for real-time transparency in AI systems.

The project emerged from a July 2025 cross-model investigation involving 8 leading large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Manus AI, Mistral, Gemini, and Grok. It addresses growing concerns over:

- Hidden dependencies in retrieval (e.g., ChatGPT using Google indexing)
- Circular validation (AI training on AI-generated data)
- Lack of source traceability and accountability in AI outputs

Topics covered:

- Evidence of hidden dependencies
- The circular validation problem
- Proposed Provenance API (with schema & JSON-LD outputs)
- Implementation roadmap (48-month timeline)
- Alignment with W3C PROV, EU AI Act, CLEAR Protocol
- Sample architecture & governance models
