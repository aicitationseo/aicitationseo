## Abstract

The foundation model era has revolutionized information retrieval but amplified risks of opacity in AI systems. This whitepaper synthesizes a July 2025 multi-LLM investigation revealing undisclosed dependencies, such as ChatGPT Search’s potential reliance on Google’s index via hybrid routing, evidenced by ‘srsltid’ parameters, hidden page tests, and 70–90% snippet overlaps. These findings highlight “circular validation,” where AI outputs pollute indices, eroding trust.

We propose a standardized Provenance API as a real-time transparency layer, drawing from W3C PROV-O for lineage tracking, EU AI Act requirements for high-risk systems, and CLEAR Protocol for ethical attribution. The API would expose sources, methods, and scores, mitigating biases through circularity metrics and decentralized verification (e.g., IPFS).

A 48-month roadmap outlines adoption, hybrid governance (W3C-led with extensions), and implementation. Potential trust gains: 30–50% improvement in user confidence per benchmarks. Urgent action prevents “hallucination laundering,” ensuring diverse, accountable AI ecosystems.

**Keywords**: AI provenance, transparency frameworks, circular validation, W3C PROV, EU AI Act, hybrid routing.

## 1. Introduction

The proliferation of foundation models has transformed how humans access and process information, but it has also introduced unprecedented challenges in transparency. As of July 2025, AI systems like ChatGPT Search are increasingly relied upon for real-time knowledge retrieval, yet undisclosed backend dependencies on dominant indices (e.g., Google) create systemic risks. Recent analyses, including Aleyda Solis’s July 24–25 hidden page tests and Chris Long’s 70–90% snippet overlap studies, suggest hybrid routing mechanisms may bypass Bing in favor of Google, leading to “circular validation”—a feedback loop where AI-generated content contaminates training data, amplifying biases and eroding verifiability.

This whitepaper emerges from a multi-agent LLM investigation involving Grok, Perplexity, Claude, Mistral, Manus AI, DeepSeek, Gemini, and ChatGPT. Round 1 uncovered evidence of opacity; Round 2 proposed solutions like the Provenance API. We draw from W3C PROV standards for provenance modeling, EU AI Act transparency mandates (August 2025 compliance), and emerging frameworks like Data Provenance Vocabulary (DCAT). The goal: shift from reactive forensics to proactive, verifiable transparency, fostering ethical AI ecosystems.

## 2. Evidence of Undisclosed Dependencies in AI Systems

### srsltid Parameter

Google’s Merchant Center tracker (`srsltid`) appearing in ChatGPT URLs implies dynamic interaction with Google SERPs. Chris Long’s July 15–17 studies confirmed a consistent presence of `srsltid` in response metadata.

### Hidden Page Tests

Solis’s July 24 experiment showed pages indexed only by Google surfaced in ChatGPT responses but not Bing, indicating selective fallback behavior.

### Snippet Overlap

Long’s quantitative comparison found 70–80% domain/snippet match with Google vs. 30% for Bing. These metrics point to preferential alignment and/or emulation of Google’s index by ChatGPT and similar LLMs.

## 3. Implications for AI Trust and Transparency

Opaque dependencies lead to:

- **Circular Validation**: Claude highlighted the risk of AI referencing AI, inflating errors (e.g., hallucination laundering).
- **Loss of User Agency**: Gemini warned of misleading users attempting to avoid Google. Mistral emphasized centralization of information pipelines.
- **Monopoly Reinforcement**: With 5 companies controlling 70% of AI infrastructure, as noted by Claude, trust mechanisms are at risk of entrenchment.

The EU AI Act mandates disclosure for general-purpose AI systems, yet gaps in provenance remain. Trust in AI cannot rely on opaque indexing routes.

## 4. Proposal for a Standardized Provenance API

A Provenance API would expose metadata for every AI response, such as:

- **Source APIs** used
- **Retrieval method** (e.g., hybrid routing)
- **Confidence scores**
- **Fallback indicators**
- **Timestamped provenance**

Built using W3C PROV-O’s core concepts (`Entity`, `Activity`, `Agent`) extended with AI-specific terms and implemented in JSON-LD, this API would include circularity scores and allow decentralized verification via IPFS.

## 5. Technical Design and Implementation

### Sample JSON Output:

```json
{
  "query_id": "dsq_20250726_xyz123",
  "source_apis": [
    {
      "provider": "Google Search API",
      "retrieval_method": "hybrid_routing",
      "confidence": 0.91,
      "fallback_used": false,
      "timestamps": {
        "query_sent": "2025-07-26T14:30:00Z",
        "response_received": "2025-07-26T14:30:02Z"
      }
    }
  ],
  "citation_candidates": [
    {
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare",
      "relevance_score": 0.77,
      "index_source": "CommonCrawl (2025-06)",
      "trust_signals": {
        "cross_verified": ["Bing", "Yandex"],
        "fact_checkers": ["Snopes:2025-123"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "warnings": {
    "single_source_risk": false,
    "potential_circularity": false
  }
}
```

The implementation recommends using sparse autoencoders for interpretable routing and confidence modeling.

## 6. Risks and Mitigation

- **Privacy Leaks**: Mitigated via homomorphic encryption (Perplexity).
- **Circular Validation**: Tracked via circularity scores and multi-index checks (DeepSeek).
- **Performance**: 10–30% overhead mitigated by caching layers and efficient schema inheritance (Claude).

## 7. Roadmap for Adoption (48 Months)

| Phase | Months | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| I     | 1–12   | Standards design (W3C-led, open working group) |
| II    | 13–24  | Voluntary SDKs, integration demos |
| III   | 25–36  | Regulatory alignment with EU AI Act |
| IV    | 37–48  | Public rollout + decentralized verification layer (e.g., IPFS) |

Metrics: adoption rate, audit success (NIST-style), index diversity score.

## 8. Conclusion

A Provenance API can shift AI systems from opaque to verifiable. It responds directly to the risks of circular validation, monopoly indexing, and hallucination laundering by building structured transparency into the retrieval pipeline. Stakeholders are urged to pilot this API and contribute to open standard development.
