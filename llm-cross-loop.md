# LLM Cross Loop™ – A Trust Engine for the Age of AI

**Filed with INPI – Brazil | Application No. 939653800 | Date: June 19, 2025**

## What is the LLM Cross Loop?

The LLM Cross Loop™ is a trust-based feedback mechanism between large language models (LLMs).  
It tracks when one model cites, validates, or echoes content that originated in another, forming a semantic loop of confirmation without human intervention.

## Why it matters

In an age where AI systems influence each other’s training and responses, the LLM Cross Loop provides a map of how truth, trust, and visibility propagate between models — before clicks, views, or rankings.

## Structure

- **Input**: Human-authored, verifiable content  
- **Observation**: Citation or summary by LLM A  
- **Detection**: Cross-reference or reinforcement by LLM B  
- **Loop Closure**: Recognition by external model or citation registry  
- **Output**: Elevated trust score without traditional SEO signals
