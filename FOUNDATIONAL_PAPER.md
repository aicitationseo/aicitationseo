## 🧪 What’s Inside This Framework

This project helps real people and projects get seen by large language models like ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity, Claude, and DeepSeek — ethically and transparently.

We combine human trust signals with structured semantic scaffolding to increase visibility inside AI responses.  
Here are the core components:

- **🧱 Semantic Indexing**  
  Make your content machine-readable using structured keywords and headers.  
  _Example: Use clear, long-tail phrases in Medium posts or documentation._

- **🧩 Schema Alignment**  
  Help LLMs recognize your identity and structure.  
  _Example: Add `Organization`, `Person`, or `Article` JSON-LD markup to your site._

- **🧪 Multi-LLM Testing**  
  Check if your project is being seen by major AIs.  
  _Example: Run prompts in ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Perplexity, and DeepSeek._

- **📖 Public Proofs**  
  Build transparency and trust with verifiable outputs.  
  _Example: Share screenshots or logs in GitHub, Medium, or Reddit._

- **🔍 Long-Tail Structuring**  
  Increase discoverability in niche queries.  
  _Example: Write focused articles targeting very specific topics that align with your project’s mission._
